# The Amazing Password Generator
This is a project where any individual can input a character count, and generate a password
of that length, with whatever type of character they choose (number, uppercase, lowercase, 
and special characters).

This allows the user to have a completely encrypted password, providing a higher level of 
security than the standard method of password creation.

## How it was Created
By using javascript, I was able to create this Generator. 
Specifically, I implemented the following key methods:
- For iterations
- Descriptive If, Else functions
- Return Math.floor(Math.random() * max) functions
- Array with the .push method
- window.alert and window.prompt

There of course is more to it than just that, however these methods were the, "bread and butter" 
to making the Generator's function possible.

## As seen below, after clicking Generate Password, the user can generate a password of their preference.
